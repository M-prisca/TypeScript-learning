# My TypeScript Learning Journey

Welcome to my TypeScript learning repository! This repo is a personal log of my progress as I learn and explore TypeScript â€“ a powerful, typed superset of JavaScript.


## Why Iâ€™m Learning TypeScript

As a developer who already knows JavaScript, I realized how TypeScript can:
- Improve code reliability with static typing
- Enhance code readability and scalability
- Provide better developer tooling (autocompletion, refactoring, etc.)

## What This Repo Contains

This repository includes:
-  My practice exercises and projects
-  Notes and code snippets
-  Mini challenges and concepts breakdown
-  Commits that show step-by-step progress

## Final Goal

To become confident in writing scalable, readable, and type-safe applications using TypeScript.
